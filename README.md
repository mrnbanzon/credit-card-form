# Credit Card Form

### Based off of one of the coding challenges presented in this Medium article:
https://medium.com/better-programming/here-are-6-frontend-challenges-to-code-9952190c97cc

### The original version of this project was done in Vue at the following GitHub repo:
https://github.com/muhammederdem/credit-card-form

#### NOTE:
Currently there is no backend, so the submit button does not do anything. Will consider adding that
functionality later.

### To Run:
1. run: npm install
2. run: npm run build
3. open dist/index.html in your local browser (will think about changing this later)
